# Circuit-Synth Repository Breakup Strategy

## Executive Summary

After analyzing kicad-skip and circuit-synth's architecture, I've identified **5 high-value standalone repositories** that could be extracted from circuit-synth. Each addresses specific market needs and has independent value for the broader electronics design community.

**Key Insight**: Circuit-synth has evolved far beyond kicad-skip's capabilities, particularly in areas like exact file format control, library sourcing intelligence, and AI-assisted design workflows.

## kicad-skip vs Circuit-Synth Comparison

### kicad-skip Foundation (What Circuit-Synth Built Upon)

**Core Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ S-expression parsing with `sexpdata` library
- ‚úÖ REPL-friendly exploration and tab completion
- ‚úÖ Basic schematic manipulation (symbols, wires, properties)
- ‚úÖ Simple delete functionality (`delete()` method on parsed values)
- ‚úÖ Named attribute access (`schematic.symbol.R1.property.Value`)

**Limitations**:
- ‚ùå **No exact file format preservation** (formatting may change)
- ‚ùå **Limited library sourcing** (no external API integration)  
- ‚ùå **Basic component management** (no advanced placement algorithms)
- ‚ùå **No manufacturing integration** (no DfM, supplier data)
- ‚ùå **No AI/automation features** (purely manual scripting)

### Circuit-Synth Improvements

## Conclusion

Circuit-synth has evolved significantly beyond kicad-skip and contains multiple high-value components that could succeed as independent repositories. The **kicad-exact** foundation represents the highest immediate value, while **component-intelligence** and **memory-bank** address large market needs.

**Recommendation**: Start with extracting `kicad-exact` as a proof-of-concept, then proceed based on market response and technical lessons learned.

The repository breakup strategy positions each component to serve specific market needs while maintaining the ability to integrate them for comprehensive solutions. This approach maximizes both community adoption and commercial potential.
