# Documentation Accuracy Fixes

Based on user feedback and technical review, the following inaccurate claims have been corrected:

## ✅ **Technical Inaccuracies Fixed**

### 1. KiCad "Binary Files" Claim (Forum Feedback)
**Before**: "Binary KiCad files | Git-friendly Python source"  
**After**: "GUI-based KiCad editing | Text-based Python circuit definitions"  
**Reality**: KiCad files (.kicad_sch, .kicad_pcb, .kicad_pro) are text-based S-expressions, not binary.

### 2. Performance Claims
**Before**: "100x faster," "10-50x faster," "97% of generation time"  
**After**: "Faster with Rust acceleration," "Enhanced performance"  
**Reality**: Performance improvements exist but specific numbers were unsubstantiated.

### 3. Test Plan Generation
**Status**: ✅ **Accurate** - Fully automated via Claude Code agents  
**Reality**: The test-plan-creator agent generates complete test procedures automatically.

### 4. Schematic Quality
**Before**: "Clean, readable schematics that look hand-drawn"  
**After**: Removed this claim  
**Reality**: Generates complete, accurate schematics with hierarchical labels - users handle beautification.

### 5. Bidirectional Sync
**Before**: "Seamless bidirectional sync," "Import existing KiCad → Modify → Sync back"  
**After**: "Import works well, updating existing projects is experimental"  
**Reality**: 
- KiCad → Python import: ✅ Works well
- Python → New KiCad project: ✅ Works well  
- Updating existing KiCad projects: ⚠️ Experimental, has limitations

### 6. Manufacturing Integration
**Before**: "Assembly optimization and cost analysis"  
**After**: "Component availability checking and sourcing guidance"  
**Reality**: JLCPCB web scraping for component availability, DFM/FMEA guidance via agents.

## ✅ **AI Marketing Language Removed**

### 1. Claude Integration Documentation
**Before**: "*Revolutionary AI-Powered Circuit Design Experience*" + "*most advanced Claude Code integration available*"  
**After**: Technical documentation of actual commands and agents  

### 2. Contributing Guide
**Before**: "*Welcome to the most contributor-friendly EE design tool ever built!*"  
**After**: Standard technical contributing guidelines

### 3. Performance Claims
**Before**: "*Issue #40: Component processing acceleration (97% of generation time!)*"  
**After**: Removed unsubstantiated statistics

## ✅ **Honest Limitations Added**

### Current State Documentation:
- Bidirectional sync is experimental with known limitations
- Schematic generation focuses on accuracy over beautification  
- Manufacturing integration is component-focused, not assembly-line optimization
- Performance improvements exist but aren't benchmarked with specific numbers

## **Result**
Documentation now focuses on what circuit-synth actually does rather than marketing hype, with honest assessments of current capabilities and limitations.
