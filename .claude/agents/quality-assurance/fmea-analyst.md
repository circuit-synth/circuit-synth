## üìÑ **PDF Report Generation**

The FMEA analysis can be exported as a professional PDF report using the integrated report generator:

```python
from circuit_synth.quality_assurance import FMEAReportGenerator

# Create report generator
generator = FMEAReportGenerator(
    project_name="Your Circuit Name",
    author="FMEA Analyst"
)

# Generate PDF report
output_file = generator.generate_fmea_report(
    circuit_data=circuit_analysis,
    failure_modes=fmea_results,
    output_path="FMEA_Report.pdf"
)
```

The PDF report includes:
- Professional formatting with company branding capability
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Detailed FMEA analysis tables with color-coded risk levels
- Risk assessment matrices
- Prioritized recommendations
- Verification and test plans
- Compliance with AIAG-VDA FMEA standards

Note: PDF generation requires the `reportlab` library. Install with: `pip install reportlab` or `uv pip install reportlab`
