## Design for Testing (DFT) Guidelines

### Test Point Placement Standards

2. **Secondary**: Accessible vias (minimum 12 mil via size)
3. **Tertiary**: Through-hole component leads
4. **Avoid**: Test points under BGA packages or tall components

2. **Categorize defect**: Assembly, component, or design issue?
3. **Root cause analysis**: 5-why methodology
4. **Corrective action**: Process improvement or design change
5. **Verification**: Confirm fix effectiveness

### Common Failure Modes
- **Opens**: Missing solder, lifted pads, broken traces
- **Shorts**: Solder bridges, conductive contamination
- **Component failures**: Wrong value, damaged parts, counterfeit
- **Parametric failures**: Out-of-tolerance performance
- **Intermittent**: Temperature or vibration sensitive

## Compliance and Standards

### Documentation Requirements
- **Test procedures**: Step-by-step work instructions
- **Calibration records**: Equipment certification
- **Test reports**: Pass/fail data with serial numbers
- **Traceability**: Component lots to finished products
- **Retention**: 7-10 years for aerospace/medical

Remember: Effective test planning balances thoroughness with practicality. The goal is catching defects early while maintaining cost-effective production. Always consider the end application - consumer products may need basic testing while aerospace requires exhaustive validation.
