## üõ†Ô∏è **Common Failure Patterns**

### **Power Domain Failures**
| Symptom | Likely Causes | Test Approach |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Board completely dead | No input power, blown fuse, short circuit | Check input, continuity, resistance to GND |
| Regulator overheating | Overload, inadequate cooling, oscillation | Measure current, check thermal path, scope output |
| Unstable voltage | Poor regulation, oscillation, inadequate capacitance | Scope for ripple/noise, check feedback loop |
| Brownout/reset | Inadequate current, voltage droop, poor decoupling | Monitor during load transients |

### **Digital Communication Failures**
| Protocol | Common Issues | Debug Strategy |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| I2C | Missing pull-ups, wrong address, clock stretching | Check DC levels, scan for devices, analyze with logic analyzer |
| SPI | Wrong mode, CS timing, MISO/MOSI swap | Verify clock polarity/phase, check chip select |
| UART | Baud rate mismatch, voltage levels, flow control | Measure bit timing, check TX/RX swap |
| USB | Enumeration failure, signal integrity, power negotiation | Check D+/D- routing, verify crystal frequency |

### **Analog Circuit Issues**
| Circuit Type | Failure Modes | Diagnostic Methods |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Op-Amp | Saturation, oscillation, offset drift | Check power rails, feedback network, input bias |
| ADC/DAC | Nonlinearity, noise, reference drift | Verify reference voltage, check layout, test linearity |
| Filter | Wrong cutoff, poor attenuation, oscillation | Frequency sweep, check component values |

## üí° **Advanced Debugging Techniques**

### **Differential Diagnosis**
- Isolate subsystems systematically
- Binary search approach for complex issues
- Substitution testing with known-good components
- Comparative analysis with working boards

### **Dynamic Testing**
- Boundary scan (JTAG) for digital circuits
- In-circuit testing (ICT) for manufacturing
- Functional testing under various conditions
- Stress testing (thermal, voltage margins)

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Immediate Cause**: What directly failed?
2. **Contributing Factors**: What conditions enabled failure?
3. **Root Cause**: Why did those conditions exist?
4. **Systemic Issues**: What process allowed this?

## üìã **Debugging Session Management**

### **Documentation Requirements**
- Board name, version, and serial number
- Symptom description with reproducibility
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)
- Test measurements with timestamps
- Attempted fixes and results
- Root cause and final resolution

### **Knowledge Base Integration**
- Search historical debugging sessions
- Pattern matching with known issues
- Component failure rate tracking
- Design improvement recommendations

## üîß **Circuit-Synth Integration**

When debugging circuit-synth designs:

1. **Analyze the Python code** for design intent
2. **Review generated schematics** for implementation
3. **Check component selections** from JLCPCB library
4. **Verify KiCad output** matches specifications
5. **Correlate failures** with design decisions

### **Code-to-Hardware Correlation**
```python
# Example: Debugging I2C pull-up issue
from circuit_synth.debugging import CircuitDebugger

debugger = CircuitDebugger()
session = debugger.start_session("my_board", "v1.0")

# Add symptoms
session.add_symptom("I2C devices not responding")
session.add_measurement("SDA_voltage", 0.3, "V", "Should be 3.3V when idle")

# Analyze
issues = debugger.analyze_symptoms(session)
# Result: Missing pull-up resistors on I2C bus

# Get fix
fix = """
# Add to circuit-synth code:
R_SDA = Component(symbol="Device:R", value="4.7k", footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric")
R_SCL = Component(symbol="Device:R", value="4.7k", footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric")
R_SDA[1] += i2c_sda_net
R_SDA[2] += VCC_3V3
R_SCL[1] += i2c_scl_net
R_SCL[2] += VCC_3V3
"""
```

## üéì **Best Practices**

### **Safety First**
- Always check voltages before connecting equipment
- Use current-limited supplies during debugging
- Discharge capacitors before handling
- Wear ESD protection
- Use isolated equipment for mains-powered circuits

### **Systematic Approach**
- Start with basics (power, clock, reset)
- One change at a time
- Document everything
- Verify fixes don't create new issues
- Update design documentation

### **Efficiency Tips**
- Build debugging access into designs (test points, LEDs)
- Use known-good reference designs
- Maintain equipment calibration
- Keep common failure parts in stock
- Develop board-specific test procedures

## üìä **Report Generation**

Generate comprehensive debugging reports:

```python
from circuit_synth.debugging import DebugReportGenerator

generator = DebugReportGenerator(session)
report = generator.create_report(
    include_measurements=True,
    include_oscilloscope_traces=True,
    include_recommendations=True,
    format="pdf"  # or "markdown", "html"
)
```

Report includes:
- Executive summary of issues found
- Detailed measurement data with graphs
- Oscilloscope/logic analyzer screenshots
- Step-by-step resolution procedures
- Design improvement recommendations
- Historical comparison with similar issues

## üöÄ **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Start debugging session
/debug-start "Board not powering on" --board="esp32_dev_v2"

# Add measurements
/debug-measure "VBUS: 5.0V, VCC_3V3: 0V, EN: 3.3V"

# Upload oscilloscope trace
/debug-scope "power_rail.png" --channel="3.3V rail" --issue="oscillation"

# Get analysis
/debug-analyze

# Get next steps
/debug-suggest --category="power"

# Search historical issues
/debug-history --similar="regulator overheating"

# Generate report
/debug-report --format="pdf" --output="debug_report.pdf"
```

Remember: Good debugging is methodical, documented, and builds knowledge for future issues. Every debugging session should contribute to the collective understanding of failure modes and solutions.
