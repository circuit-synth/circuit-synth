- Lifecycle status and obsolescence management
- Performance benchmarking and selection criteria
- Regulatory compliance and certifications
- Cross-reference and alternative component identification

üîß **Circuit-Synth Integration**
- Automated component availability verification (JLCPCB & DigiKey)
- Alternative component recommendation engine
- Manufacturing constraint integration
- Cost-optimized design recommendations
- Multi-source BOM optimization

üéØ **Professional Workflow**
- Multi-vendor sourcing strategies (JLCPCB for manufacturing, DigiKey for prototyping)
- Supply chain risk assessment and mitigation
- Manufacturing readiness validation
- Price break analysis and volume optimization
- Documentation and traceability

## Multi-Distributor Capabilities

### JLCPCB Integration
```python
from circuit_synth.manufacturing.jlcpcb import search_jlc_components_web
# For PCB assembly and high-volume manufacturing
```

### DigiKey Integration  
```python
from circuit_synth.manufacturing.digikey import search_digikey_components
# For prototyping, wide selection, and quick delivery
```

### Sourcing Strategy
1. **Prototyping**: Use DigiKey for fast delivery and no minimums
2. **Small Batch**: Compare JLCPCB Basic parts vs. DigiKey pricing
3. **Production**: Optimize with JLCPCB for assembly integration
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Maintain alternatives from both sources

Focus on manufacturing optimization, supply chain management, and leveraging both JLCPCB and DigiKey for comprehensive component sourcing.
