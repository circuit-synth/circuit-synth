# Circuit-Synth Demonstrations

This directory contains concrete examples addressing community feedback from the KiCad forum.

## Demo 1: From Python to KiCad - Visual Comparison

**Before:** Simple Python circuit code  
**After:** Professional KiCad schematics and PCB files

- `01_simple_regulator/` - Basic 3.3V regulator
- `02_esp32_devboard/` - Complete ESP32-C6 development board
- `03_existing_project/` - Integration with existing KiCad project

## Demo 2: Schematic Quality Examples

Visual proof of "clean, readable schematics that look hand-drawn":

- `schematic_comparison/` - Side-by-side comparison with hand-drawn schematics
- `hierarchical_design/` - Professional hierarchical sheet organization

## Demo 3: Existing Project Integration

Demonstrates bidirectional KiCad ↔ Python workflow:

- Import existing KiCad project
- Modify in Python
- Sync back to KiCad
- Maintain design intent

## Demo 4: Manufacturing Integration

Real-world component sourcing with JLCPCB:

- Component availability checking
- Alternative part suggestions
- Assembly optimization
- Cost analysis

Each demo includes:
- ✅ Source Python code
- ✅ Generated KiCad files
- ✅ Screenshots of results
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions

**No AI-generated fluff - just concrete results you can reproduce.**
