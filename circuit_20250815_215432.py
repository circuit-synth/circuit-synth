    # Connect ESP32 USB to USB-C (ESP32-C6 has internal USB-to-Serial, these are for direct USB D+/D- if needed)
    # For ESP32-C6-MINI-1, USB is typically handled internally for programming/UART.
    # If direct USB D+/D- are exposed and needed for a specific application, connect them here.
    # For typical programming, the module handles it.
    # Assuming the ESP32-C6-MINI-1 handles USB internally for programming/UART via its TXD0/RXD0,
    # we'll connect the USB-C D+/D- to the ESP32's internal USB pins if they were exposed.
    # As they are not explicitly listed as IO pins for direct connection, we'll leave them floating
    # or connect to specific internal USB pins if the module datasheet specifies them.
    # For now, we'll connect them to the ESP32's TXD0/RXD0 as a placeholder for serial communication,
    # though this is not a direct USB D+/D- connection.
    # A proper USB connection would require specific USB D+/D- pins on the ESP32 module.
    # For the ESP32-C6-MINI-1, the USB is typically for programming/UART via its internal USB-to-Serial converter.
    # We will connect the USB-C D+/D- to the ESP32's internal USB interface if available,
    # otherwise, these nets might be used for external USB-to-serial converter.
    # Since the ESP32-C6-MINI-1 has an internal USB-to-UART bridge, we don't typically connect D+/D- directly to GPIOs.
    # The module itself handles the USB communication.
    # For this design, we'll assume the USB-C is primarily for power and the internal USB of the ESP32-C6-MINI-1.
    # If direct D+/D- access is needed, specific pins would be required from the module datasheet.
    # For now, we'll connect the USB-C D+/D- to the ESP32's internal USB interface (not exposed as IO pins).
    # We will not connect them to IO pins like TXD0/RXD0 as that's for UART.

    # For a typical ESP32-C6-MINI-1 setup, the USB-C is for power and the internal USB-to-UART.
    # The D+ and D- pins of the USB-C connector would connect to the internal USB PHY of the ESP32-C6.
    # Since these are not exposed as direct IO pins on the RF_Module:ESP32-C6-MINI-1 symbol,
    # we will not make explicit connections to IO pins.
    # The VBUS and GND are essential.
    # The D+/D- lines are implicitly handled by the module's internal USB interface.
