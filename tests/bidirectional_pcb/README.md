# PCB Bidirectional Sync Tests

Comprehensive test suite for validating bidirectional synchronization between Python circuit definitions and KiCad PCB files.

## Status

**Phase**: Planning
**Status**: PRD Complete, Implementation Pending
**Target**: 25+ comprehensive PCB-level bidirectional tests

## Overview

This test suite mirrors the architecture and philosophy of `tests/bidirectional/` (schematic tests), but focuses on PCB-level operations including:

- **Component Placement**: Position preservation, footprint changes, rotation
- **Routing**: Trace preservation, via placement, differential pairs
- **Layers**: Multi-layer boards, power/ground planes, copper pours
- **Design Rules**: DRC synchronization, clearances, track widths
- **Manufacturing**: Gerber generation, pick-and-place, assembly data

## Philosophy

**The Killer Feature for PCB**: Position preservation when adding components during iterative development.

Just like schematic test 09 proves that manually-positioned components stay in place when regenerating, PCB test 03 will prove that **manual PCB layout work is preserved** when making changes in Python.

Without this, the tool is unusable for real PCB design. With this validated, engineers can trust circuit-synth for production boards.

## Why PCB Tests Are Critical

**Current Problem:**
- ‚ùå No validation that manual PCB placement survives changes
- ‚ùå No proof that routing is preserved
- ‚ùå No verification of design rule synchronization
- ‚ùå Engineers won't trust tool for real boards

**With PCB Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Validates placement preservation (hours of layout work)
- ‚úÖ Proves routing survives component additions
- ‚úÖ Verifies design rules transfer correctly
- ‚úÖ Enables production-ready PCB workflow
- ‚úÖ Engineers can trust tool for real projects

## Real-World Workflows Validated

### Iterative PCB Development
1. Generate PCB from Python
2. Manually place components for optimal layout
3. Route critical traces
4. Add decoupling caps in Python
5. Regenerate ‚Üí **positions AND traces preserved** ‚úÖ

### Footprint Optimization
1. Design with 0805 passives
2. Layout and route
3. Change to 0603 in Python
4. Regenerate ‚Üí **layout preserved** ‚úÖ

### High-Speed Design
1. Define differential pairs in Python
2. Route with length matching
3. Add termination resistors
4. Regenerate ‚Üí **routing preserved** ‚úÖ

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 (Core operations, placement preservation)
- **Week 3-4**: Phase 2 (Component ops, routing preservation)
- **Week 5-6**: Phase 3 (Layers, design rules)
- **Week 7-8**: Phase 4 (Advanced features)
- **Week 9-10**: Phase 5 (Manufacturing integration)

## Getting Started

**Current Status**: PRD phase - tests not yet implemented.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review [PCB_BIDIRECTIONAL_TESTS_PRD.md](./PCB_BIDIRECTIONAL_TESTS_PRD.md)
2. Validate approach with stakeholders
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Create test 01-05 following schematic test patterns
