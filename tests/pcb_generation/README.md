# PCB Bidirectional Sync Tests

Focused test suite for validating bidirectional synchronization of **component placement operations** between Python circuit definitions and KiCad PCB files.

## Status

**Phase**: Planning
**Status**: PRD Complete, Implementation Pending
**Target**: 21 comprehensive PCB tests (placement + vias + manufacturing)
**Scope**: Component placement, via management, footprint management, board setup, manufacturing
**Out of Scope**: Complex trace routing preservation (users route in KiCad)

## Overview

This test suite mirrors the architecture and philosophy of `tests/bidirectional/` (schematic tests), but focuses on **PCB component placement operations**:

**‚úÖ IN SCOPE (What We Test):**
- **Component Placement**: Position preservation, auto-placement, manual adjustments
- **Via Management**: Through-hole vias, blind vias, buried vias (essential for multi-layer)
- **Footprint Management**: Footprint changes, library sync, assignment
- **Component Operations**: Add, delete, modify, rotate components
- **Board Setup**: Board outline, mounting holes, mechanical features
- **Board Features**: Silkscreen text, fiducials, graphics
- **Manufacturing**: Gerber/drill generation, pick-and-place, BOM with positions

**‚ùå OUT OF SCOPE (What We Don't Test):**
- **Complex Routing**: Trace preservation, differential pairs, autorouting (users route in KiCad)
- **Advanced Layers**: Power/ground plane zones, copper pours (future)
- **Routing Algorithms**: Length matching, impedance control (not circuit-synth's focus)

**Future Scope (Nice-to-Have):**
- **Simple Trace Drawing**: Basic Python-defined point-to-point traces
- **Orthogonal Routing**: 90¬∞ angle traces from vias to pads

**Why This Scope?** Circuit-synth focuses on intelligent component placement and essential board elements (vias). Users do complex routing in KiCad (the right tool for manual routing). **The killer features are placement preservation + via management**.

## Philosophy

**The Killer Feature for PCB**: **Placement preservation** when adding/modifying components during iterative development.

Just like schematic test 09 proves that manually-positioned components stay in place when regenerating, PCB test 03 will prove that **manual component placement work is preserved** when making changes in Python.

**Reality Check**: Users accept re-routing when components change (routing is manual in KiCad anyway). The critical feature is **preserving hours of placement work**, not routing work.

Without placement preservation, the tool is unusable for real PCB design. With this validated, engineers can trust circuit-synth for production boards.

## Why PCB Tests Are Critical

**Current Problem:**
- ‚ùå No validation that manual placement survives Python changes
- ‚ùå No proof that component operations work bidirectionally
- ‚ùå No verification of footprint change workflows
- ‚ùå Engineers won't trust tool for real boards

**With Comprehensive PCB Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Validates placement preservation (hours of placement work)
- ‚úÖ Proves component add/delete/modify operations work correctly
- ‚úÖ Verifies footprint changes preserve positions
- ‚úÖ **Validates via placement** (through-hole, blind, buried) for multi-layer boards
- ‚úÖ Verifies manufacturing output accuracy (Gerbers, PnP, BOM)
- ‚úÖ Enables iterative PCB workflow (placement + vias)
- ‚úÖ **Clear expectations**: circuit-synth for placement/vias, KiCad for complex routing
- ‚úÖ Engineers can trust tool for production boards

## Real-World Workflows Validated

### Iterative PCB Development (Realistic)
1. Generate PCB from Python (smart auto-placement, auto-via power/ground)
2. **Manually adjust component positions** in KiCad for optimal layout
3. **Route traces in KiCad** (manual routing - not automated)
4. Add decoupling caps + power vias in Python
5. Regenerate ‚Üí **component positions preserved** ‚úÖ, **vias added** ‚úÖ, **accept re-routing** (expected)

### Footprint Optimization (Realistic)
1. Design with 0805 passives, place and route in KiCad
2. Realize 0603 saves board space
3. Change footprints to 0603 in Python
4. Regenerate ‚Üí **placement positions preserved** ‚úÖ, re-route traces (expected)

### Multi-Layer Board Workflow (4-Layer Example)
1. Generate 4-layer PCB from Python (F.Cu, In1.Cu, In2.Cu, B.Cu)
2. Place components in KiCad for optimal layout
3. Add through-hole vias for power/ground in Python
4. Add blind vias (F.Cu ‚Üí In1.Cu) for dense routing in Python
5. Regenerate ‚Üí **all positions preserved** ‚úÖ, **vias added** ‚úÖ
6. **Route signal traces in KiCad** (use vias for layer transitions)
7. **Verify connectivity** with DRC in KiCad
