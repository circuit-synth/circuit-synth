Fixture: 4-Layer PCB with Through-Hole Vias.

Creates a 4-layer PCB (F.Cu, In1.Cu, In2.Cu, B.Cu) with 3 through-hole vias that
connect all 4 layers. Through-hole vias are used for power distribution and signal
routing across multiple internal layers.

Through-hole vias:
- Connect ALL layers (F.Cu ‚Üí B.Cu via internal layers)
- Typically 0.3-0.5mm drill diameter
- Used for power/ground distribution in multi-layer boards
- Via 1 at (10mm, 10mm)
- Via 2 at (20mm, 20mm)
- Via 3 at (30mm, 30mm)
