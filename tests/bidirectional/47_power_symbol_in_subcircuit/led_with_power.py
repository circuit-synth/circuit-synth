"""
Fixture: LED circuit with power symbols IN subcircuit (not root).

This tests power distribution through hierarchical circuits:
- Root sheet: Establishes VCC power rail
- Child sheet (LED_Circuit): Contains LED and power symbols

This is a CRITICAL real-world pattern: power nets originate on root
but are distributed to child sheets where components connect via local
power symbols and hierarchical labels.

Starting point:
- One LED (D1) with VCC/GND power symbols in child sheet
- Power symbols commented out initially for test validation

Test will add second LED (D2) to verify power symbol reuse.
