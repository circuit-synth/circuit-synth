Fixture: Single resistor circuit for component type swap test.

This circuit starts with a single 10kŒ© resistor (Device:R).
The test will change this to a capacitor (Device:C) while keeping
the reference as "R1" and position preserved.

Used for testing component symbol type changes during iterative design.
