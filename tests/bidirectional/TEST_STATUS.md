## Net Topology Operations (Tests 24-32) - NEW

### üöß Test 24: Remove Component from Net
**Status:** BLOCKED by #344
**Created:** 2025-10-26

**Notes:** Inverse of test 11

### üöß Test 27: Change Pin on Existing Net
**Status:** BLOCKED by #344
**Created:** 2025-10-26
**Predicted:** FAIL - label movement not tracked
**Notes:** Edge case test

### üöß Test 28: Split Net
**Status:** BLOCKED by #344

### üöß Test 33: Power Symbol Replacement (CRITICAL)
**Status:** UNTESTED (CRITICAL architectural issue)
**Created:** 2025-10-26
**Issue:** #346 - Power symbol vs hierarchical label semantics
**Predicted:** Power symbols not preserved, new components get labels
**Notes:**
- Tests manual power symbol replacement in KiCad
- Circuit-synth generates hierarchical labels for power (GND, VCC)
- KiCad best practice is power symbols (global connection)
- Hierarchical labels DON'T connect across sheets (broken for multi-sheet)
- **This affects EVERY circuit with power nets**
- Critical architectural decision needed

## Known Issues Blocking Tests

### #336: Component Deletion Doesn't Work
**Blocks:** Test 07, Test 26
**Impact:** Deletion operations detected but not executed
**Severity:** High

### #338: Component Rename Treated as Delete+Add
**Blocks:** Test 23
**Impact:** Need canonical circuit analysis
**Severity:** High

### #344: Bidirectional Sync Doesn't Add Hierarchical Labels (CRITICAL)
**Blocks:** Tests 11, 13, 24-32
**Impact:** Adding nets to existing components doesn't create labels
**Severity:** CRITICAL - breaks iterative workflow
**Root Cause:** Sync doesn't track net changes

### #345: New Component on Existing Net Doesn't Get Labels (CRITICAL)
**Blocks:** Tests 12, 13, 24-32
**Impact:** Adding components to existing nets doesn't create labels
**Severity:** CRITICAL - breaks net expansion
**Root Cause:** Same as #344 - net sync broken

### #346: Power Symbol vs Hierarchical Label Semantics (CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL)
**Blocks:** Test 33, all multi-sheet designs
**Impact:** Circuit-synth generates hierarchical labels for power nets (GND, VCC)
**Severity:** CRITICAL - affects correctness of ALL circuits with power
**Root Cause:** Architectural decision - no power symbol support
**Key Issues:**
- Hierarchical labels don't connect across sheets (multi-sheet broken)
- KiCad best practice is power symbols for power distribution
- User-added power symbols likely lost on regeneration
- Every real circuit has power nets
**Must fix before:** 1.0 release

### #331, #334, #335: PCB Generation Issues
**Blocks:** All PCB-related functionality
**Impact:** PCB sync completely broken
**Severity:** High (separate from schematic sync)

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. **Component generation** - Fresh components appear correctly
2. **Component value modification** - Values update during sync
3. **Position preservation** - Manual layout preserved when adding components
4. **Fresh net generation** - Nets work when generating from scratch
5. **Round-trip schematic** - Can import/export schematics

### What's Broken ‚ùå
1. **Component deletion** - Detected but not executed (#336)
2. **Component rename** - Treated as delete+add (#338)
3. **Net sync - add** - Labels don't appear when adding nets (#344)
4. **Net sync - modify** - Topology changes not tracked (#345)
5. **Net sync - delete** - Labels don't disappear (predicted)
6. **PCB generation** - Multiple errors (#331, #334, #335)

### Critical Gaps üöß
- **All net topology operations** (tests 24-32) blocked
- **Power rails** (test 13) likely broken
- **Complex scenarios** (tests 14-23) mostly untested

---

## Next Testing Priorities

### High Priority (Do Next)
1. ‚úÖ Test 13: Power rails - validate if GND/VCC works
2. ‚è≥ Test 17: Create net - validate basic net creation
3. ‚è≥ Test 14-15: Incremental growth, move component

### Medium Priority (After Fixes)
4. Tests 24-32: All net topology tests (after #344/#345 fixed)
5. Test 23: Canonical rename (after #338 fixed)

### Low Priority
6. Remaining tests 16-22
7. PCB test suite (#340)

---

## Metrics

**Test Success Rate:** 6.25% (2/32 confirmed passing)
**Critical Failures:** 2 (tests 11, 12)
**Blocked Tests:** 11 (tests 24-32, 13)
**Coverage Gaps:** Net operations (0% validated for sync)

**Conclusion:** Bidirectional sync works for basic component operations but is completely broken for net operations. This is a critical gap preventing iterative circuit development.
