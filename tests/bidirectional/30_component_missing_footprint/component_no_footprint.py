Fixture: Component without footprint assignment.

Represents a common real-world scenario:
- Component defined with symbol (Device:R)
- No footprint yet assigned (footprint="")
- Developer will add footprint later after design choices are made

Used to test graceful handling of incomplete component metadata
during iterative circuit design.
