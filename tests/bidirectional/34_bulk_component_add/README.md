# Test 34: Bulk Component Add

## What This Tests
Validates that adding multiple similar components at once (10 resistors) works correctly in the KiCad schematic, with proper positioning and no conflicts.

## When This Situation Happens
- Real designs often need multiple identical or similar components
- Engineer wants to add a bank of resistors (pull-ups, pull-downs, etc.)
- Performance matters: adding 10 components should be fast and not degrade quality
- All components should auto-place without overlaps or conflicts

## What Should Work
- Python code creates 10 resistors (R1-R10) in a grid pattern (2 columns, 5 rows)
- Initial generation places all 10 components successfully
- Each component has correct reference, value, and footprint
- Components are positioned without overlaps in a logical grid
- Modifying one component doesn't affect others
- Adding R11 in Python preserves positions of R1-R10 and places R11 in new location
- Performance: bulk operation completes in reasonable time

## Manual Test Instructions

```bash
cd /Users/shanemattner/Desktop/circuit-synth2/tests/bidirectional/34_bulk_component_add

# Step 1: Generate initial KiCad project with 10 resistors
uv run ten_resistors.py
open ten_resistors/ten_resistors.kicad_pro

# Verify in KiCad:
# - Schematic has R1 through R10 all visible
# - All components have value "10k"
# - All components properly placed in grid pattern without overlaps
# - All components in same location as before (position preservation)

# Step 2: Edit ten_resistors.py to uncomment R11
# Uncomment the R11 component block at the bottom

# Step 3: Regenerate KiCad project
uv run ten_resistors.py

# Step 4: Open regenerated KiCad project
open ten_resistors/ten_resistors.kicad_pro

# Step 5: Verify in KiCad:
# - R1-R10 still present and in original positions
# - R11 added (11th resistor)
# - R11 placed without overlapping R1-R10
# - All 11 components visible and accessible

# Step 6: Check synchronization log
# Look for:
# - "✅ Preserved: R1" through "✅ Preserved: R10"
# - "➕ Add: R11" (or similar addition indication)
```

## Performance Expectations
- Initial generation with 10 components: <5 seconds
- Regeneration with 11 components: <5 seconds
- Grid-based placement ensures predictable, non-overlapping positions

## Why This Is Critical

**Real-World Use Cases:**
1. **Pull-up/Pull-down resistor banks** - Common in digital circuits (10+ resistors needed)
2. **Termination resistors** - Data buses need resistors on multiple lines
3. **Component filtering** - Adding filter capacitors to multiple supply rails
4. **Bulk replacement** - Swapping all resistors in a filter network

**Technical Validation:**
- **Bulk Operations**: Confirms system handles multiple components efficiently
- **Position Preservation**: R1-R10 positions don't change when R11 added
- **Auto-Placement**: Algorithm handles dense component placement
- **Performance**: Doesn't degrade with moderately large component count
- **Synchronization**: Correctly detects which components were added vs. preserved

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All 10 resistors generate with unique references (R1-R10)
- ✅ All 10 resistors have correct values (10k) and footprints
- ✅ Components positioned in 2x5 grid without overlaps
- ✅ After modification, R1-R10 positions preserved
- ✅ R11 added successfully in new position
- ✅ All 11 components present in regenerated schematic
- ✅ Synchronization log shows correct additions/preservations
