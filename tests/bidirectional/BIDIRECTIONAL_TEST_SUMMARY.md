```

### Key Achievement: Hierarchical Operations Gap CLOSED

**Critical Finding:** Tests 01-38 almost exclusively operated on ROOT SHEET ONLY. This left a massive gap in hierarchical circuit testing.

**Solution:** Tests 39-65 prioritize hierarchical operations:
- ✅ Component modifications in subcircuits (test 39)
- ✅ Net operations within child sheets (test 40)
- ✅ Power distribution through hierarchy (tests 44, 47, 48)
- ✅ Cross-sheet component operations (tests 41, 42)
- ✅ Hierarchical pin management (tests 59, 60)

### Issue #406: Hierarchical Sheets - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem:** Components in hierarchical child sheets displayed as "R?" instead of correct reference designators

**Root Cause:** kicad-sch-api was not preserving hierarchical instance paths through save/load cycles

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **kicad-sch-api v0.4.5** (PR #78 merged, released to PyPI)
   - Added `instances` field to SchematicSymbol dataclass
   - Modified save logic to preserve user-set instances instead of generating defaults
   - Proper round-trip preservation through save/load cycles

2. **circuit-synth PR #417** (merged to main)
   - Updated dependency: kicad-sch-api >= 0.4.5
   - No code changes needed - existing instance setting logic now works correctly

3. **Test 22 Validation**
   - ✅ Generates root sheet with R1 successfully
   - ✅ Generates child sheet with R2 successfully
   - ✅ Components appear with correct references in KiCad
   - ✅ Hierarchical instance paths preserved in .kicad_sch files
   - ✅ JSON netlist reflects hierarchical structure

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Issue #373: Netlist Exporter Empty Nets Section

**Affected Tests:** Test 36, Test 43  
**Impact:** Cannot validate electrical connectivity via netlist  
**Status:** Issue marked CLOSED but tests still fail - needs investigation

### Issue #380: Synchronizer Doesn't Remove Old Hierarchical Labels

**Affected Tests:** Test 59, Test 60, Test 58  
**Impact:** Old labels persist when pins removed/renamed  
**Status:** Open issue, needs synchronizer enhancement

### Power Symbol Handling

**Affected Tests:** Test 45, 46, 47, 48  
**Impact:** Power import/export/subcircuit support incomplete  
**Status:** Needs comprehensive power symbol enhancement

### Global Label Support

**Affected Tests:** Test 57, Test 58  
**Impact:** circuit-synth uses hierarchical labels by design  
**Status:** Documented limitation (architectural decision)

## Manual Testing Checklist

| Test Range | Manual Testing Status | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|-------|
| 01-11 | ✅ Manually tested | Visually inspected in KiCad GUI |
| 12-65 | ⚠️ Automated only | Need manual GUI validation |

**TODO:** Incrementally validate tests 12-65 by opening in KiCad GUI

## Performance Benchmarks

```
Total Execution: 61.56 seconds (34 test functions)
Average: ~1.8 seconds per test

Test 61 (100 components): ~8.5s
- Generation: ~2.5s
- Synchronization: ~1.8s
- Position preservation: ✅ All 100 components

Conclusion: ✅ Scales well to realistic circuit sizes
```

## Future Recommendations

### High Priority Gaps
1. Delete operations in subcircuits
2. Net removal operations
3. More subcircuit operation coverage

### Medium Priority Gaps
4. Multi-level hierarchy (2-3 levels deep)
5. Component instances across sheets
6. Sheet reuse patterns
