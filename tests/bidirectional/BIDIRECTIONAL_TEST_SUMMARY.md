### Key Achievement: Hierarchical Operations Gap CLOSED

**Critical Finding:** Tests 01-38 almost exclusively operated on ROOT SHEET ONLY. This left a massive gap in hierarchical circuit testing.

**Solution:** Tests 39-65 prioritize hierarchical operations:
- ‚úÖ Component modifications in subcircuits (test 39)
- ‚úÖ Net operations within child sheets (test 40)
- ‚úÖ Power distribution through hierarchy (tests 44, 47, 48)
- ‚úÖ Cross-sheet component operations (tests 41, 42)
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical pin management (tests 59, 60)

## Test Rewrites and New Tests (2025-10-29)

### Test 22: Progressive Subcircuit Addition (REWRITTEN)
**Old Purpose:** Single-step subcircuit addition (broken, Issue #406)
**New Purpose:** Incremental hierarchy development (1‚Üí2‚Üí3 levels)
**Files:** `progressive_hierarchy.py`, `test_22_progressive_subcircuit_addition.py`, `README_progressive.md`
**Status:** XFAIL (blocked by Issue #406 - subcircuit generation)
**Validates:** Adding subcircuits incrementally, hierarchical sheet symbols at each level

### Test 24: Cross-Sheet Hierarchical Connection (REWRITTEN)
**Old Purpose:** Same-sheet "global label" test (redundant with test 10)
**New Purpose:** Cross-sheet hierarchical connection via net passing
**Files:** `hierarchical_connection.py`, `test_24_cross_sheet_connection.py`, `README.md`
**Status:** XFAIL (blocked by Issue #406)
**Validates:** Passing Net from parent to child creates hierarchical pins/labels

### Test 66: Duplicate Net Names Isolation (NEW SAFETY TEST)
**Purpose:** Ensure Net("SIGNAL") in circuit_a ‚â† Net("SIGNAL") in circuit_b
**Files:** `isolated_circuits.py`, `test_66_duplicate_net_names_isolation.py`, `README.md`
**Status:** Ready to test (not hierarchical)
**Validates:** R1‚ÄîR2 on one net, R3‚ÄîR4 on different net, no accidental merging
**Critical:** Prevents dangerous bug where same net names accidentally connect unrelated circuits

### Test 67: Connected Multi-Level Hierarchy (NEW ULTIMATE TEST)
**Purpose:** Combine progressive hierarchy + cross-sheet connectivity
**Files:** `connected_hierarchy.py`, `test_67_connected_multi_level_hierarchy.py`, `README.md`
**Status:** XFAIL (blocked by tests 22+24 dependencies)
**Validates:** R1‚ÄîR2‚ÄîR3 connected across 3 hierarchy levels via net passing
**Significance:** If this passes, hierarchical design is FULLY functional

### Test 27: Add Junction (REMOVED)
**Old Purpose:** Test junction dot creation when T-connections occur
**Removal Reason:** Architecturally invalid - circuit-synth uses hierarchical labels instead of physical wires
**Rationale:**
- Circuit-synth doesn't draw wires between components
- Each component pin gets its own hierarchical label
- Junction dots only appear when physical wires cross/meet
- Since no wires are drawn, junctions will never be generated
- Test assumption (T-connections create junctions) doesn't apply to label-based architecture

### Key Philosophy Changes
1. **No global nets** - All connections explicit via net passing
2. **Safety first** - Test 66 ensures duplicate names don't merge
3. **Incremental development** - Test 22 validates step-by-step hierarchy
4. **Complete workflow** - Test 67 combines everything into ultimate test
5. **Architecture alignment** - Removed test 27 (incompatible with label-based design)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### üî¥ Issue #427: Hierarchical Labels Not Generated for Net Connections (CRITICAL - NEW)

**Discovered:** 2025-10-30 during Test 28 and Test 59 validation
**Affected Tests:** Test 28, Test 59, Test 60, Test 58, and ALL hierarchical circuits with net connections
**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Net connections invisible in KiCad schematics
**Status:** Open - Blocking entire hierarchical circuit workflow

**Problem:** When nets are connected to components in subcircuits (`resistor[1] += data_in`), NO hierarchical labels are generated in the .kicad_sch file. Components render but appear unconnected.

**Evidence:**
- Test 28: LM358 and connectors render, but no net labels (INPUT_A, OUTPUT_A, VCC, VEE)
- Test 59: R1 resistor renders, but no "DATA_IN" hierarchical label
- Warning: "Net 'DATA_IN' has only 1 connection(s) - may indicate connection issue"

**Root Cause:** Schematic writer not generating hierarchical labels for net connections in subcircuits

### üî¥ Issue #410: PCB Synchronization Broken (CRITICAL - REOPENED)

**Reopened:** 2025-10-30 - Previously thought fixed, but still broken
**Affected Tests:** Test 30 (Component Missing Footprint)
**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Cannot sync footprints from schematic to PCB
**Status:** Reopened - Three separate bugs identified

**Problems:**
1. **PCB Generator** doesn't read footprint from Python Component object
2. **Component Manager** can't find component R1 (even though it exists)
3. **PCB Synchronizer** doesn't read footprint from schematic file

**Evidence from Test 30:**
- Warning: "Component R1 not found"
- Warning: "R1 has no footprint, skipping"
- PCB file remains empty despite footprint defined in Python code
- Schematic correctly has footprint property

### Issue #373: Netlist Exporter Empty Nets Section

**Affected Tests:** Test 36, Test 43, Test 15 (was blocking)
**Impact:** Cannot validate electrical connectivity via netlist
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-10-29):** Test 15 now XPASS!
- Test 15 was expected to fail due to this issue
- During manual validation, test 15 actually passes
- This suggests the netlist functionality may be working better than expected
- Recommend re-investigating Issue #373 status

### Issue #380: Synchronizer Doesn't Remove Old Hierarchical Labels

**Affected Tests:** Test 59, Test 60, Test 58
**Impact:** Old labels persist when pins removed/renamed
**Status:** Claimed fixed by commits bc8b795, but cannot test due to Issue #427 blocking

### Issue #426: Custom KiCad Library Support Not Exposed (NEW)

**Created:** 2025-10-30
**Impact:** Users cannot use custom symbol libraries (company parts, vendor libs)
**Status:** Feature exists internally but no user-facing API
**Priority:** Medium-High - Important for professional use

### Power Symbol Handling

**Affected Tests:** Test 45, 46, 47, 48
**Impact:** Power import/export/subcircuit support incomplete
**Status:** Needs comprehensive power symbol enhancement

### Global Label Support

**Affected Tests:** Test 57, Test 58
**Impact:** circuit-synth uses hierarchical labels by design
**Status:** Documented limitation (architectural decision)
