```

### Key Achievement: Hierarchical Operations Gap CLOSED

**Critical Finding:** Tests 01-38 almost exclusively operated on ROOT SHEET ONLY. This left a massive gap in hierarchical circuit testing.

**Solution:** Tests 39-65 prioritize hierarchical operations:
- ‚úÖ Component modifications in subcircuits (test 39)
- ‚úÖ Net operations within child sheets (test 40)
- ‚úÖ Power distribution through hierarchy (tests 44, 47, 48)
- ‚úÖ Cross-sheet component operations (tests 41, 42)
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical pin management (tests 59, 60)

## Test Rewrites and New Tests (2025-10-29)

### Test 22: Progressive Subcircuit Addition (REWRITTEN)
**Old Purpose:** Single-step subcircuit addition (broken, Issue #406)
**New Purpose:** Incremental hierarchy development (1‚Üí2‚Üí3 levels)
**Files:** `progressive_hierarchy.py`, `test_22_progressive_subcircuit_addition.py`, `README_progressive.md`
**Status:** XFAIL (blocked by Issue #406 - subcircuit generation)
**Validates:** Adding subcircuits incrementally, hierarchical sheet symbols at each level

### Test 24: Cross-Sheet Hierarchical Connection (REWRITTEN)
**Old Purpose:** Same-sheet "global label" test (redundant with test 10)
**New Purpose:** Cross-sheet hierarchical connection via net passing
**Files:** `hierarchical_connection.py`, `test_24_cross_sheet_connection.py`, `README.md`
**Status:** XFAIL (blocked by Issue #406)
**Validates:** Passing Net from parent to child creates hierarchical pins/labels

### Test 66: Duplicate Net Names Isolation (NEW SAFETY TEST)
**Purpose:** Ensure Net("SIGNAL") in circuit_a ‚â† Net("SIGNAL") in circuit_b
**Files:** `isolated_circuits.py`, `test_66_duplicate_net_names_isolation.py`, `README.md`
**Status:** Ready to test (not hierarchical)
**Validates:** R1‚ÄîR2 on one net, R3‚ÄîR4 on different net, no accidental merging
**Critical:** Prevents dangerous bug where same net names accidentally connect unrelated circuits

### Test 67: Connected Multi-Level Hierarchy (NEW ULTIMATE TEST)
**Purpose:** Combine progressive hierarchy + cross-sheet connectivity
**Files:** `connected_hierarchy.py`, `test_67_connected_multi_level_hierarchy.py`, `README.md`
**Status:** XFAIL (blocked by tests 22+24 dependencies)
**Validates:** R1‚ÄîR2‚ÄîR3 connected across 3 hierarchy levels via net passing
**Significance:** If this passes, hierarchical design is FULLY functional

### Test 27: Add Junction (REMOVED)
**Old Purpose:** Test junction dot creation when T-connections occur
**Removal Reason:** Architecturally invalid - circuit-synth uses hierarchical labels instead of physical wires
**Rationale:**
- Circuit-synth doesn't draw wires between components
- Each component pin gets its own hierarchical label
- Junction dots only appear when physical wires cross/meet
- Since no wires are drawn, junctions will never be generated
- Test assumption (T-connections create junctions) doesn't apply to label-based architecture

### Key Philosophy Changes
1. **No global nets** - All connections explicit via net passing
2. **Safety first** - Test 66 ensures duplicate names don't merge
3. **Incremental development** - Test 22 validates step-by-step hierarchy
4. **Complete workflow** - Test 67 combines everything into ultimate test
5. **Architecture alignment** - Removed test 27 (incompatible with label-based design)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Issue #373: Netlist Exporter Empty Nets Section

**Affected Tests:** Test 36, Test 43, Test 15 (was blocking)
**Impact:** Cannot validate electrical connectivity via netlist
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-10-29):** Test 15 now XPASS!
- Test 15 was expected to fail due to this issue
- During manual validation, test 15 actually passes
- This suggests the netlist functionality may be working better than expected
- Recommend re-investigating Issue #373 status

### Issue #380: Synchronizer Doesn't Remove Old Hierarchical Labels

**Affected Tests:** Test 59, Test 60, Test 58  
**Impact:** Old labels persist when pins removed/renamed  
**Status:** Open issue, needs synchronizer enhancement

### Power Symbol Handling

**Affected Tests:** Test 45, 46, 47, 48  
**Impact:** Power import/export/subcircuit support incomplete  
**Status:** Needs comprehensive power symbol enhancement

### Global Label Support

**Affected Tests:** Test 57, Test 58  
**Impact:** circuit-synth uses hierarchical labels by design  
**Status:** Documented limitation (architectural decision)
