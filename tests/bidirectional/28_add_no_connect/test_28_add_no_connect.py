Automated test for 28_add_no_connect bidirectional test.

Tests CRITICAL functionality: Adding no-connect flags to unused pins.

Core Question: When you mark unused pins as NO_CONNECT in Python code and
regenerate, do the no-connect symbols appear in the KiCad schematic to
prevent ERC (electrical rule check) errors?

This validates that:
1. Components with unused pins can be generated initially without NC flags
2. When pins are explicitly marked as NO_CONNECT, symbols are generated
3. No-connect symbols appear at correct pin coordinates
4. ERC validation accepts the no-connect flags
5. Component positions are preserved across regeneration

Workflow:
1. Generate KiCad with op-amp having unused pins (no NC flags initially)
2. Count no_connect symbols in schematic (should be 0)
3. Modify Python to explicitly mark Unit B pins as NO_CONNECT
4. Regenerate KiCad from modified Python
5. Validate:
   - no_connect symbols now appear in schematic
   - Symbol count increases from 0 to N (where N = number of NC pins)
   - Each symbol at correct pin coordinate
   - ERC validation would accept the no-connect flags

Validation uses Level 2 semantic validation:
- kicad-sch-api for schematic structure analysis
- Text search for (no_connect elements in .kicad_sch file
- Component position verification

    """Test adding no-connect flags to unused pins during iterative development.

    CRITICAL TEST:
    Validates that unused pins can be marked as NO_CONNECT in Python code,
    and no-connect symbols appear in regenerated KiCad schematic.

    Workflow:
    1. Generate with op-amp having unused pins (no NC flags, count = 0)
    2. Modify Python to mark Unit B pins as NO_CONNECT
    3. Regenerate → no-connect symbols should appear (count > 0)
    4. Validate symbols at correct coordinates
    5. Verify ERC would accept the no-connect flags

    Why critical:
    - Without no-connect flags, ERC reports false "unconnected pin" errors
    - Marking pins as NO_CONNECT explicitly marks intentional unused pins
    - ERC then validates cleanly without false positives
    - This is essential for real circuit design with multi-pin ICs

    Level 2 Semantic Validation:
    - kicad-sch-api for schematic structure
    - Text search for (no_connect pattern in .kicad_sch file
    - Component position verification across regeneration
