Fixture: Level shifter circuit with multiple voltage domains in subcircuit.

This tests multi-voltage power distribution through hierarchical circuits:
- Root sheet: VCC_5V and VCC_3V3 power rails (two voltage domains)
- Child sheet (Level_Shifter): Contains level shifter circuit requiring BOTH voltages

This is a CRITICAL real-world pattern: subcircuits that need multiple voltage
domains (like level shifters interfacing between 5V and 3.3V systems).

Circuit topology:
- VCC_5V: Powers 5V side pull-up resistor (R1)
- VCC_3V3: Powers 3.3V side pull-up resistor (R2)
- Q1: N-channel MOSFET (BSS138) for level shifting
- GND: Common ground reference

Starting point:
- One level shifter (Q1, R1, R2) with dual voltage power symbols in child sheet
- Test will add second level shifter (Q2, R3, R4) to verify power symbol reuse
