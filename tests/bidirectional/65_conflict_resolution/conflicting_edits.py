Fixture: Circuit for testing conflict resolution.

Initial state: R1=10k, R2=1k
Conflict scenario:
  - Python edit: R1‚Üí47k, add R3=4.7k
  - KiCad edit: R1‚Üí22k, add R4=100k (manual, not in Python)

Tests circuit-synth behavior when same component modified in both Python and KiCad
without intermediate synchronization.

Real-world use case: Developer forgets to import KiCad changes before editing Python,
or multiple developers working on same circuit simultaneously.
