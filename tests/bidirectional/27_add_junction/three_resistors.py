Fixture: Three resistors in T-connection (junction required).

Phase 1: T-connection where R2's pin splits to connect both R1 and R3
- Creates a three-way connection point requiring a junction dot
- All three pins are on the same net (NET1)
- Junction appears visually to clarify the connection

To modify to Y-connection, edit this file and create separate nets:
- net1 = Net(name="NET1")
- net1 += r1[1]
- net1 += r2[1]
-
- net2 = Net(name="NET2")
- net2 += r3[1]
