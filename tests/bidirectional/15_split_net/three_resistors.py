Fixture: Three resistors all connected via a single net.

Phase 1: All three resistors (R1, R2, R3) connected via NET1
This is used to:
1. Generate initial circuit with all 3 on single net
2. Verify netlist shows NET1 with 3 pins

To split the net, edit this file and move R3 to NET2:
- net1 = Net(name="NET1")
- net1 += r1[1]
- net1 += r2[1]
- (remove: net1 += r3[1])
-
- net2 = Net(name="NET2")
- net2 += r3[1]
