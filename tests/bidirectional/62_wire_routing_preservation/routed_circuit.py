Fixture: Two resistors connected via SIGNAL net for wire routing preservation test.

This circuit is used to test whether custom wire routing paths (with corners,
multiple segments) are preserved during bidirectional sync.

Workflow:
1. Generate KiCad with straight-line wire (default)
2. Manually route wire with L-shaped path in KiCad
3. Modify component value in Python
4. Regenerate ‚Üí Check if routing preserved or reset
