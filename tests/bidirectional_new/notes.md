- testing of basics of making a new python file, generating a kicad project, adding a resistor in kicad, and import back to python is working
    - adding another resistor to python and exporting back to kicad is working as well
- next we need to test:
  - change components subcircuits
  - add new subcircuits
  - change connection names
  - add net names
  -
