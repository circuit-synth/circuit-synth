## Critical Tests (Must Pass for Release)

🔴 **Test 03: Position Preservation** (6 tests)
- Component positions survive Python updates
- Auto-placement doesn't disturb existing components

🔴 **Test 06: Round-Trip** (5 tests)
- Python → KiCad → Python preserves circuit
- Multiple cycles are stable

🔴 **Test 07: User Content Preservation** (7 tests)
- Python comments survive sync
- Docstrings preserved
- No data loss

🔴 **Test 08: Idempotency** (6 tests)
- Deterministic output
- No random changes
- Git-friendly behavior

**Critical Test Count**: 24 tests that MUST pass

## Next Steps

### Immediate (You Need to Do)

1. **Create KiCad Fixtures** (~2 hours)
   - Follow `MANUAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Start with P0 fixtures (blank, single_resistor, resistor_divider)
   - Creates the reference KiCad projects for tests

2. **Create Python Fixtures** (~30 min)
   - Write `.py` files matching KiCad fixtures
   - Located in `fixtures/<name>/<name>.py`
   - Examples in fixture README

### Then (I Can Help With)

3. **Write Test Code**
   - Create `test_*.py` files in each directory
   - Implement test cases from READMEs
   - Start with 01_blank_projects (simplest)

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/bidirectional_new/01_blank_projects/ -v
   ```

5. **Iterate**
   - Fix failures
   - Add missing test cases
   - Improve documentation

## Documentation Provided

### Main Docs
- **README.md** - Overview, test catalog, running tests
- **MANUAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step KiCad fixture creation
- **SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - This file (what was built)

### Per-Directory READMEs (14 files)
Each test directory has detailed README with:
- Purpose and "why this matters"
- Specific test cases with code examples
- Expected outputs
- Debugging guides
- Success criteria
- Manual setup instructions

### Fixture Docs
- **fixtures/README.md** - Fixture guidelines, creation instructions, validation

## What Makes This Different from Old Tests

### Old Suite (`tests/bidirectional/`)
- ⚠️ Tests mixed together, hard to understand
- ⚠️ Some API calls deprecated
- ⚠️ 8 failures out of 45 tests (80% passing but unclear what's broken)
- ⚠️ Sparse documentation
- ⚠️ Hard to know what's tested and what's missing

### New Suite (`tests/bidirectional_new/`)
- ✅ **Clear organization**: 12 categories, numbered by complexity
- ✅ **Comprehensive docs**: README for every directory
- ✅ **Isolated tests**: Each test is self-contained and understandable
- ✅ **Priority-driven**: P0 critical tests clearly marked
- ✅ **Manual setup guide**: Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ **82 test cases** planned and documented
- ✅ **Fresh start**: No legacy API issues

## Fixture Creation Priority

### Week 1: P0 Fixtures (Core Functionality)
1. `blank/` - 5 min
2. `single_resistor/` - 10 min
3. `resistor_divider/` - 15 min
4. `positioned_resistor/` - 10 min

**Total**: ~40 minutes → Enables 22+ tests

### Week 2: P1 Fixtures (Extended Coverage)
5. `three_types/` - 15 min
6. `series_chain/` - 15 min
7. Additional variants as needed

**Total**: ~30 minutes → Enables 15+ tests

### Week 3+: P2/P3 Fixtures (Advanced)
8. `hierarchical_simple/` - 30 min
9. `hierarchical_complex/` - 1 hour

**Total**: ~1.5 hours → Enables all tests

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1: Foundation (P0 Tests Passing)
- ✅ Blank project tests (3/3)
- ✅ Single component tests (8/8)
- ✅ Position preservation (6/6)
- ✅ Round-trip (5/5)
- ✅ User content (7/7)
- ✅ Idempotency (6/6)

**Target**: 35 P0 tests passing → Production-ready bidirectional sync

### Phase 2: Complete (All Tests)
- ✅ All P0 + P1 tests passing (67 tests)
- ✅ P2 tests passing (hierarchical)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established

**Target**: 80+ tests passing → Full feature coverage

## Known Gaps (To Be Addressed)

1. **Test 10 (Hierarchical Restructuring)**: Feature not implemented
   - Moving components between subcircuits
   - Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.skip`

2. **KiCad Text Annotations**: May not preserve custom schematic text
   - Will document limitations
   - Future enhancement

3. **Wire Routing Preservation**: Manual wire paths may not be preserved
   - Low priority (KiCad can auto-route)

## Questions?

- Review individual test READMEs for detailed information
- Check `MANUAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for fixture creation help
- See main `README.md` for running tests

**Status**: 🚧 Structure complete, fixtures needed
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Next Action**: Create KiCad fixtures using MANUAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md
