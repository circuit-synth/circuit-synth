# Test 06: Round-Trip Validation - Full Cycle Correctness

**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL) ⚠️
**Category:** Foundation - Cycle Integrity
**Tests:** 5 total
**Status:** In Development

## Overview

CRITICAL tests validating complete Python → KiCad → Python → KiCad cycles work correctly and produce stable results.

This test suite validates that:
- Full cycle completes without errors or data loss
- Generated code is syntactically valid after import
- Circuit properties identical before and after cycle
- Idempotency: repeated cycles produce identical results
- No data accumulation or corruption through cycles
- Performance acceptable for large circuits

**Why P0 CRITICAL:** Full cycle correctness is the foundation of bidirectional sync. If cycles break, the entire feature is broken.

## Test Cases

### Test 6.1: Simple Circuit Full Cycle (3 iterations)
**What:** Python circuit → KiCad → Python → KiCad → Python
**Validates:** 3-cycle stability, idempotency proof

### Test 6.2: Full Cycle Data Integrity
**What:** All component properties identical after cycle
**Validates:** No silent data corruption

### Test 6.3: Generated Code Quality
**What:** Imported Python code is properly formatted and importable
**Validates:** Code usability, no syntax/import errors

### Test 6.4: Large Circuit Full Cycle
**What:** 10+ component circuit cycles correctly
**Validates:** Scalability, no degradation with size

### Test 6.5: Cycle Performance
**What:** Single cycle completes in reasonable time
**Validates:** No exponential slowdown
