# Test 11: Power Rail Connections (GND, VCC)

## What This Tests
Validates power rail distribution, the most fundamental and common circuit pattern - multiple components connected to GND and VCC.

## When This Situation Happens
- Every real circuit needs power distribution
- Multiple components need to connect to common GND rail
- Multiple components need to connect to common VCC rail
- Developer creates circuit with shared power connections in Python
- Generates KiCad and expects power rails to be properly represented

## What Should Work
- Circuit with multiple components sharing GND connections
- Circuit with multiple components sharing VCC connections
- KiCad project correctly represents power rail connections
- All power connections are present and properly labeled

## Manual Test Instructions
```bash
cd /Users/shanemattner/Desktop/circuit-synth/tests/bidirectional_new/11_test_power_rails

# Run automated test
uv run pytest test_power_rails.py -v -s
```

## Expected Result
```
âœ… Test 11: Power Rails PASSED
   - Circuit created with GND and VCC rails
   - Multiple components connected to power rails
   - KiCad project generated
   - All components exist in schematic
   - Power rail connections properly represented
```
