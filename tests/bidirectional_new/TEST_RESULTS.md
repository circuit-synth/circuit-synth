| 06_test_add_component | ‚úÖ PASS | Adding R2 to circuit works |
| 07_test_delete_component | ‚úÖ PASS | Removing component works |

### Position Operations (12, 15, 09)

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 12_test_set_position | ‚ö†Ô∏è PASS* | Positions not matching (unit conversion?) |
| 15_test_move_component | ‚ùå FAIL | Position changes not preserved |
| 09_test_manual_position_preservation | ‚ùå FAIL | **CRITICAL:** Manual edits lost |

**Issues Found:**
- Python: `at=(100.0, 100.0, 0)` ‚Üí KiCad: `(30.48, 35.56, 0)`
- Suggests unit conversion issue (mm vs mils?)
- Manual KiCad position edits do NOT survive Python regeneration
- **This is the killer feature** - if users lose layout work, tool is unusable

**Critical Finding:**
> Manual position edits in KiCad are LOST when regenerating from Python.
> This makes the tool unusable for real workflows where users want to:
> 1. Create circuit in Python
> 2. Manually arrange layout in KiCad
> 3. Add component in Python
> 4. Regenerate KiCad
>
> Expected: Manual layout preserved
> Actual: Manual layout lost, components reset to default positions

### Net/Connection Operations (17, 22, 10, 11)

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 17_test_create_net | ‚úÖ PASS | Creating NET1 connection works |
| 22_test_delete_net | ‚úÖ PASS | Removing connection works |
| 10_test_add_to_existing_net | ‚úÖ PASS | 3-way net (SHARED_NET) works |
| 11_test_power_rails | ‚úÖ PASS | GND/VCC rails work |

**Summary:** Net creation and power rails work correctly.

### Workflow Operations (13, 14)

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 13_test_component_rename | ‚ùå FAIL | Renamed component OK, but new components lost |
| 14_test_incremental_growth | ‚ùå FAIL | Components lost after iteration 2 |

**Issues Found:**

**Test 13 (Rename):**
- Rename R1 ‚Üí R_PULLUP in KiCad: ‚úÖ Works
- Import to Python: ‚úÖ Gets R_PULLUP
- Add R2 in Python: ‚ùå R2 doesn't appear in regenerated KiCad
- Only the imported component survives, new components lost

**Test 14 (Incremental Growth):**
- Iteration 1: R1, R2 ‚úÖ
- Import ‚Üí Add C1 ‚Üí Regenerate: ‚ùå C1 missing
- Pattern: Import-modify-regenerate loses new components

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
When importing KiCad ‚Üí Python, the generated Python code may not properly
integrate with new components added afterwards. The regeneration might only
include components that were originally imported, not newly added ones.

## Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ Issue #1: Manual Position Preservation (CRITICAL)
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Makes tool unusable for real workflows
**Tests:** 09, 12, 15
**Impact:** Users lose all manual layout work when regenerating from Python

**Expected Behavior:**
```
1. Generate KiCad from Python (R1 at default position)
2. User manually moves R1 to (100, 200) in KiCad
3. User adds R2 in Python
4. Regenerate KiCad
5. Expected: R1 still at (100, 200), R2 added
6. Actual: R1 reset to default position, manual work lost
```

**Why This Matters:**
Real engineering workflow requires:
- EE creates circuit in Python (quick, code-based)
- Layout person arranges components in KiCad (visual)
- EE adds a component in Python
- Regenerate KiCad WITHOUT losing layout work

Without this, users must choose: Python OR KiCad, not both.

---

### üî¥ Issue #2: Import-Modify-Regenerate Cycle
**Severity:** HIGH - Breaks iterative development
**Tests:** 13, 14
**Impact:** Can't iteratively grow circuits through round-trips

**Expected Behavior:**
```
1. Circuit has R1, R2
2. Import to Python
3. Add C1 in Python
4. Regenerate KiCad
5. Expected: KiCad has R1, R2, C1
6. Actual: KiCad has R1, R2 (C1 missing)
```

**Why This Matters:**
Incremental development workflow:
- Day 1: Create basic circuit
- Day 2: Import, add power regulation
- Day 3: Import, add sensor circuitry
- Each iteration should accumulate, not lose components

---

### üü° Issue #3: Position Units/Conversion
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Positions don't match expectations
**Tests:** 12
**Impact:** Position values in Python don't match KiCad

**Observations:**
- Python: `at=(100.0, 100.0, 0)` (mm assumed)
- KiCad: `(30.48, 35.56, 0)` (different scale/units)
- 100mm / 30.48 ‚âà 3.28 (possibly mm ‚Üí inches conversion?)
- Needs investigation into circuit-synth position handling

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority

1. **Fix Manual Position Preservation (Issue #1)**
   - Investigate how positions are stored/retrieved
   - Ensure imported Python includes position information
   - Preserve positions when regenerating KiCad
   - **This is make-or-break for usability**

2. **Fix Import-Modify-Regenerate (Issue #2)**
   - Debug why newly added components disappear
   - Check if imported Python code structure differs from original
   - Ensure new components integrate with imported circuit

3. **Investigate Position Units (Issue #3)**
   - Determine actual units used (mm, mils, inches)
   - Document expected behavior
   - Add unit conversion if needed

### Testing Strategy

**For Position Preservation:**
- Add logging to position handling code
- Trace position flow: Python ‚Üí KiCad ‚Üí Python ‚Üí KiCad
- Check if position info is in imported Python file

**For Import-Modify-Regenerate:**
- Compare generated Python before/after import
- Check circuit object state after import
- Verify new components are registered correctly

## Test Infrastructure Quality

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of operations
- Real-world workflow focus
- Clear, isolated tests
- Good error reporting
- Shared utilities work well

### üéØ Areas for Improvement
- Add more diagnostic output
- Include file comparisons in failures
- Add position tracing utilities
- Create regression test suite

## Next Steps

### Phase 1.6: Fix Critical Issues
1. Debug and fix manual position preservation
2. Debug and fix import-modify-regenerate cycle
3. Investigate position units

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (After fixes)
- Hierarchical subcircuits
- Multi-sheet schematics
- Bus connections
- Large circuit performance

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- Design variants
- Team collaboration scenarios
- Version control integration
- Performance optimization

---

## Conclusion

The test suite successfully identifies critical issues with bidirectional sync:

1. **Position preservation is broken** - This must be fixed for usability
2. **Iterative workflows are broken** - Can't grow circuits incrementally
3. **Basic operations work** - Generation, import, nets all functional

**The test suite has done its job**: It revealed that while basic round-trips
work, real-world workflows (manual edits, incremental development) do not.

**Focus:** Fix Issues #1 and #2 before adding more features.
