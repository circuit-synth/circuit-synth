    # Power Nets

    # Components
    # Solar Panel Input Connector

    # LiPo Battery Connector

    # TP4056 Li-Ion Charger Module (Represented by a header for a module)
    # In a real design, this would be a dedicated IC and its surrounding components.
    # For simplicity, we assume a pre-built module or a simplified representation.

    # Boost Converter (e.g., MT3608) to 5V (Represented by a header for a module)

    # 3.3V Linear Regulator (AMS1117-3.3)

    # Decoupling Capacitors for AMS1117


    # Output Nets for the subcircuit
