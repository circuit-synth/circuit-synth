# Rust KiCad Integration - Best Practices Implementation

Upgraded rust_kicad_integration crate to follow Rust best practices: added tests, examples, benchmarks, CI/CD, and proper documentation. Fixed integration with test infrastructure by correcting path resolution and handling Python features properly. Module now passes all tests and is included in regression suite.
