# Documentation Accuracy Fixes

## Summary
Fixed technical inaccuracies in documentation based on KiCad forum feedback and user clarifications.

## Key Changes
- Corrected KiCad "binary files" claim - KiCad files are text-based S-expressions
- Removed unsubstantiated performance statistics and AI marketing language
- Added honest limitations documentation for bidirectional sync and existing project integration

## Impact
Documentation now has technical credibility while maintaining authentic enthusiasm for the project.
