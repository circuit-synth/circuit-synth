# Additional Repository Options Beyond Core 3

## Your Core Strategy ✅
1. **kicad-sch-api** - File-based schematic manipulation
2. **kicad-pcb-api** - File-based PCB manipulation  
3. **memory-bank** - AI decision documentation

## 7 Additional High-Value Options

### **🔍 electronics-sourcing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**What**: Multi-supplier component lookup (DigiKey + JLCPCB + SnapEDA + Local)
**Why**: Component sourcing is daily pain for engineers, no unified library exists
**Market**: Electronics engineers, procurement teams, BOM optimization
**Components**: `manufacturing/`, `kicad/library_sourcing/`

### **🤖 ai-circuit-agents** (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**What**: Claude-based AI circuit design agent framework
**Why**: AI integration trending, no circuit-specific AI framework exists
**Market**: EDA companies, AI researchers, automation engineers  
**Components**: `ai_integration/claude/agents/`, agent registry

### **⚡ pcb-placement** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Advanced placement algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, spiral)
**Why**: Valuable for EDA tools and research, specialized niche
**Market**: EDA tool developers, research institutions
**Components**: `pcb/placement/`, `component_placement/`

### **🏭 electronics-dfm** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Design for Manufacturing analysis with supplier integration
**Why**: Important for professional manufacturing, specialized market
**Market**: Manufacturing engineers, PCB service providers
**Components**: `design_for_manufacturing/`, `quality_assurance/`

### **🔬 circuit-simulation** (LOWER PRIORITY)
**What**: SPICE integration and simulation framework
**Why**: Academic applications, but complex domain with existing solutions
**Market**: Academic researchers, simulation tool developers
**Components**: `simulation/` complete framework

### **🛣️ pcb-routing** (LOWER PRIORITY)
**What**: Freerouting and advanced routing integration  
**Why**: Specialized market, may overlap with commercial tools
**Market**: PCB routing tool developers, automation systems
**Components**: `pcb/routing/` complete integration

### **🔗 circuit-modeling** (SKIP FOR NOW)
**What**: High-level circuit design abstraction  
**Why**: Overlaps with existing libraries (SKiDL), better integrated with sch-api
**Market**: Circuit designers, educational use
**Components**: `core/circuit.py`, `core/component.py`

## Recommendation Priority

**Phase 1 (Your Core 3)**: Start here - proven strategy ✅

**Phase 2 (If successful)**: Add these high-value extensions
- `electronics-sourcing` - Clear market demand
- `ai-circuit-agents` - Trending technology

**Phase 3 (Based on feedback)**: Consider specialized tools
- `pcb-placement` - If EDA companies show interest
- `electronics-dfm` - If manufacturing market responds

**Skip for now**:
- `circuit-simulation` - Complex, existing alternatives
- `pcb-routing` - Specialized, integration complexity
- `circuit-modeling` - Better as part of sch-api
