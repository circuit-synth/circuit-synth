# PRD Summary & Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-10-22

## Two PRDs Created

### 1. Self-Improving Agents & Commands
**File**: `docs/PRD_Self_Improving_Agents.md`

**Core idea**: Add self-improvement directive to all agents/commands/skills so they can update their own prompts when they discover better approaches or encounter problems.

**Key features**:
- Agents autonomously identify improvements during execution
- Auto-update their own prompt files
- Git commits track all improvements
- Human oversight via git review

**Questions for you** (Section 8 in PRD):
- Approval workflow (auto-apply vs ask first)
- Modification scope (prompts only vs code too)
- Safety validation approach
- Opt-in/out preference
- Notification strategy
- Success metrics
- Review cadence

### 2. Multi-Agent Haiku Architecture
**File**: `docs/PRD_Multi_Agent_Haiku_Architecture.md`

**Core idea**: Default to parallel task execution with fast Haiku 4.5 agents, using Sonnet only for complex reasoning.

**Key features**:
- 3x faster execution via parallelization
- 50%+ cost reduction using Haiku
- Smart model selection (Haiku vs Sonnet)
- 5-10 parallel agents running concurrently

**NEW addition** (based on your voice note):
- `/review-claude-ecosystem` command that:
  - Searches web for latest Claude Code features
  - Reviews our agents/commands/skills
  - Suggests updates, improvements, additions
  - Keeps us aligned with Claude Code best practices

**Questions for you** (Section 9 in PRD):
- Default model preference
- Fallback behavior when Haiku fails
- Model hints in agent metadata
- Parallelization strategy
- Concurrency limits
- Metrics to track
- Dashboard location
- Ecosystem review cadence
- Auto-update approach

## Research Highlights

### Self-Improving Agents (2025 Research)
- **SICA Framework**: 17% → 53% performance improvement on benchmarks
- **Gödel Agent**: Agents rewrite their own logic dynamically
- **Safety**: Human observability critical (all changes via git)

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Hierarchical orchestration**: Main agent delegates to specialized sub-agents
- **Parallel execution**: 3x speedup demonstrated
- **Model tiering**: 60-80% cost reduction with smart routing

### Haiku 4.5 vs Sonnet 4.5
- **Speed**: Haiku 3x faster (0.36s vs 0.64s TTFT)
- **Cost**: Haiku 3x cheaper ($1/$5 vs $3/$15)
- **Quality**: Haiku 88% on code tasks, Sonnet 94%
- **Use case**: Haiku for routine tasks, Sonnet for complex reasoning

## What You Need To Do

1. **Review both PRDs**:
   - `docs/PRD_Self_Improving_Agents.md`
   - `docs/PRD_Multi_Agent_Haiku_Architecture.md`

2. **Answer the questions** (marked with checkboxes):
   - PRD 1 has 8 key questions (Section 8)
   - PRD 2 has 9 key questions (Section 9)

3. **Prioritize**: Which PRD to implement first?
   - Self-improvement (enables continuous evolution)
   - Multi-agent Haiku (immediate speed/cost benefits)
   - Both in parallel?

4. **Clarify**: Any confusion or additional requirements?

## Notes From Your Voice Input

I captured these additional ideas:

1. **Self-improvement everywhere**: "Add to all commands that the agent always looks for ways to improve"
   - ✅ Covered in PRD 1

2. **Extensive use of Claude Code skills**: "We should be making extensive use of Claude Code and skills"
   - ✅ Added `/review-claude-ecosystem` command in PRD 2

3. **Command to review Claude Code latest**: "Search the web for latest Claude Code skills, review our inventory, suggest updates"
   - ✅ Detailed in PRD 2, Section 6.2

4. **Infrastructure for easy, self-improving coding**: "Build infrastructure to make coding easy and self improving"
   - ✅ Core theme of both PRDs

## Next Steps After Review

Once you answer the questions, we can:
1. Refine the designs based on your preferences
2. Create implementation tickets
3. Start with pilot/Phase 1
4. Iterate based on learnings

Let me know if you want me to clarify anything in the PRDs or if you have more ideas to add!
