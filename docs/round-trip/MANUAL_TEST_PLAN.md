## Test 1: Basic Voltage Divider Generation

**Objective:** Generate a simple voltage divider circuit and verify it opens correctly in KiCad.

### Steps

1. Use the provided `examples/test1_basic_divider.py` or create your own:
```python
from circuit_synth import Component, Net, circuit

@circuit(name="voltage_divider")
def voltage_divider():
    r1 = Component("Device:R", ref="R1", value="10k",
                   footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric")
    r2 = Component("Device:R", ref="R2", value="10k",
                   footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric")

    vin = Net("VIN")
    vout = Net("VOUT")
    gnd = Net("GND")

    r1[1] += vin
    r1[2] += vout
    r2[1] += vout
    r2[2] += gnd

    return r1, r2

c = voltage_divider()
c.generate_kicad_project("voltage_divider", force_regenerate=True, generate_pcb=False)
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
uv run python examples/test1_basic_divider.py
```

**Objective:** Manually wire the circuit in KiCad and verify wires are preserved.

### Steps

1. In KiCad schematic editor:

   - Use the "Wire" tool (W) to connect:
     - R1 pin 1 ‚Üí add wire going left, add label "VIN"
     - R1 pin 2 ‚Üí R2 pin 1 (direct wire connection)
     - R2 pin 1 ‚Üí add wire going right, add label "VOUT"
     - R2 pin 2 ‚Üí add wire going down, add label "GND"
   - Save the schematic (Ctrl+S)

2. Record wire positions (for verification later):
   - Note approximate coordinates of each wire segment
   - Take a screenshot for reference

### Expected Results

- [ ] All wires drawn successfully

   - Reference: C1
   - Value: 100n
   - Footprint: _______
   - Connections: VOUT (pin 1), GND (pin 2)

3. Create `test2_with_manual_cap.py` to explicitly include C1:
```python
from circuit_synth import Component, Net, circuit

@circuit(name="voltage_divider")
def voltage_divider():
    r1 = Component("Device:R", ref="R1", value="220k",
                   footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_1206_3216Metric")

## Test 19: Replace Hierarchical Labels with Direct Power Symbol Connections

**Objective:** Verify that power symbols directly connected to components (instead of hierarchical labels) are preserved.

**Scenario:** This tests a very common KiCad workflow where users delete hierarchical labels and connect power symbols directly to component pins for cleaner schematics.

### Steps

1. Generate a fresh voltage divider circuit:
```bash
uv run python test1_basic_divider.py
```

2. In KiCad schematic editor:
   - Delete the VIN hierarchical label
   - Delete the GND hierarchical label
   - Press "P" to add power port
   - Search for "power:+3V3" (or "power:VCC")
   - Place power symbol directly above R1
   - Use wire tool to connect power symbol to R1 pin 1
   - Add another power port: "power:GND"
   - Place GND symbol directly below R2
   - Use wire tool to connect GND symbol to R2 pin 2
   - Keep the VOUT hierarchical label (for testing mixed approach)
   - Save the schematic

3. Document the power symbol connections:
   - VCC symbol (#PWR0X): Connected to R1 pin 1
   - GND symbol (#PWR0Y): Connected to R2 pin 2
   - VIN hierarchical label: DELETED
   - GND hierarchical label: DELETED
   - VOUT hierarchical label: KEPT
   - Screenshot for reference

4. Re-run Python script without changes:
```bash
uv run python test1_basic_divider.py
```

5. Open schematic in KiCad and verify

### Expected Results

- [ ] Power symbol on R1 pin 1 preserved ‚úÖ
- [ ] Power symbol on R2 pin 2 preserved ‚úÖ
- [ ] Wire connections to power symbols intact ‚úÖ
- [ ] VOUT hierarchical label still present ‚úÖ
- [ ] VIN hierarchical label did NOT reappear ‚úÖ
- [ ] GND hierarchical label did NOT reappear ‚úÖ
- [ ] R1 and R2 values unchanged
- [ ] All manual wiring preserved

### Critical Verification

**CRITICAL:** This tests that circuit-synth respects the user's choice to use power symbols instead of hierarchical labels. The synchronizer should NOT re-create deleted hierarchical labels.

### Advanced: Update Component Value

6. Modify `test1_basic_divider.py` - change R1 value to 33k:
```python
r1 = Component("Device:R", ref="R1", value="33k",  # Changed
               footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric")
```

7. Run the script:
```bash
uv run python test1_basic_divider.py
```

8. Open schematic and verify:

- [ ] R1 value updated to 33k ‚úÖ
- [ ] Power symbol on R1 still connected ‚úÖ
- [ ] GND power symbol on R2 still connected ‚úÖ
- [ ] Wire connections maintained ‚úÖ
- [ ] No hierarchical labels reappeared ‚úÖ

### Use Case

This test validates the common professional workflow where:
1. Engineer generates schematic from Python (with hierarchical labels)
2. Engineer replaces hierarchical labels with direct power connections for cleaner schematics
3. Engineer continues to update component values in Python
4. All manual wiring and power symbol choices are preserved

### Notes

**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started / ‚è≥ In Progress / ‚úÖ Passed / ‚ùå Failed

**Design Note:** Power symbols are semantically different from hierarchical labels:
- Hierarchical labels: Used for hierarchical design, connecting to parent sheets
- Power symbols: Global power connections, cleaner for flat schematics

Circuit-synth should respect the user's choice and not force one over the other.
