# FMEA Analysis Guide

## Overview

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) in circuit-synth provides automated reliability analysis for electronic circuit designs. The system analyzes circuits to identify potential failure modes, assess their risk, and recommend mitigation strategies.

### What is FMEA?

FMEA is a systematic methodology for:
- **Identifying** potential failure modes in components and systems
- **Analyzing** the effects of each failure on the circuit
- **Prioritizing** risks using Risk Priority Numbers (RPN)
- **Recommending** design improvements to reduce risk

### Key Features

- **Automated component analysis** - Identifies 13+ component types and their specific failure modes
- **Comprehensive failure database** - Pre-loaded with industry-standard failure modes for common components
- **Context-aware risk assessment** - Adjusts ratings based on circuit environment and stress factors
- **Professional PDF reports** - Publication-ready analysis with executive summaries and detailed tables
- **Physics-based reliability models** - References Arrhenius, Coffin-Manson, and Black's equation
- **IPC Class 3 compliance** - High-reliability assembly standards

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

Analyze any circuit file (Python or JSON):

```bash
# Analyze a Python circuit file
uv run python -m circuit_synth.tools.quality_assurance.fmea_cli my_circuit.py

# Analyze with custom output filename
uv run python -m circuit_synth.tools.quality_assurance.fmea_cli my_circuit.py -o report.pdf

# Analyze a circuit directory
uv run python -m circuit_synth.tools.quality_assurance.fmea_cli ./ESP32_Project/
```

### Python API

```python
from circuit_synth.quality_assurance import analyze_any_circuit

# Perform FMEA analysis and generate PDF report
report_path = analyze_any_circuit(
    circuit_path="my_circuit.py",
    output_pdf="FMEA_Report.pdf",
    verbose=True
)

print(f"Report generated: {report_path}")
```

## Understanding FMEA Reports

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

The RPN quantifies risk severity using three factors:

**RPN = Severity Ã— Occurrence Ã— Detection**

Each factor is rated on a scale of 1-10:

#### Severity (S)
How serious is the effect of the failure?
- **10**: Catastrophic - Safety hazard, complete system failure
- **8-9**: Critical - Major function loss, potential damage
- **6-7**: Moderate - Partial function loss, degraded performance
- **4-5**: Minor - Small impact, reduced capability
- **1-3**: Negligible - Minimal effect, barely noticeable

#### Occurrence (O)
How likely is the failure to occur?
- **10**: Very High - Failure almost inevitable (>1 in 2)
- **8-9**: High - Repeated failures (1 in 3 to 1 in 8)
- **6-7**: Moderate - Occasional failures (1 in 20 to 1 in 80)
- **4-5**: Low - Relatively few failures (1 in 400 to 1 in 2,000)
- **1-3**: Remote - Failure unlikely (<1 in 15,000)

#### Detection (D)
How likely is the failure to be detected before reaching the customer?
- **10**: Absolute Uncertainty - Cannot detect
- **8-9**: Very Remote - Very unlikely to detect
- **6-7**: Low - Low likelihood of detection
- **4-5**: Moderate - Moderate likelihood of detection
- **2-3**: High - High likelihood of detection
- **1**: Almost Certain - Defect is obvious and will be caught

### Risk Levels

Based on the calculated RPN:

| Risk Level | RPN Range | Action Required | Priority |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Critical** | â‰¥ 300 | Immediate action required | ðŸ”´ HIGH |
| **High** | 125-299 | Action required before production | ðŸŸ  HIGH |
| **Medium** | 50-124 | Monitor and improve if feasible | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM |
| **Low** | < 50 | Acceptable risk level | ðŸŸ¢ LOW |

## Example Workflow

### Complete FMEA Process

1. **Design your circuit** in circuit-synth Python:

```python
from circuit_synth import Circuit, USB_C, LDO, MCU, Capacitor

with Circuit("ESP32_DevBoard") as circuit:
    usb = USB_C("J1", "USB_C_Receptacle")
    ldo = LDO("U1", "AMS1117-3.3", input_voltage="5V")
    mcu = MCU("U2", "ESP32-C6")

    # Power distribution
    usb["VBUS"] >> ldo["VIN"]
    ldo["VOUT"] >> mcu["VDD"]

    # Decoupling
    Capacitor("C1", "10uF", "0805") | (ldo["VIN"], ldo["GND"])
    Capacitor("C2", "10uF", "0805") | (ldo["VOUT"], ldo["GND"])
```

2. **Run FMEA analysis**:

```bash
uv run python -m circuit_synth.tools.quality_assurance.fmea_cli ESP32_DevBoard.py -o FMEA_Report.pdf
```

3. **Review the report**:
   - Check critical/high-risk failures (RPN â‰¥ 125)
   - Note specific recommendations
   - Identify components needing protection

4. **Implement improvements**:

```python
from circuit_synth import Circuit, USB_C, LDO, MCU, Capacitor, TVS_Diode

with Circuit("ESP32_DevBoard_v2") as circuit:
    usb = USB_C("J1", "USB_C_Receptacle")

    # Add ESD protection (addresses RPN 288 "ESD damage" failure mode)
    tvs = TVS_Diode("D1", "USBLC6-2SC6", package="SOT-23-6")
    usb["VBUS"] >> tvs["IN"]

    ldo = LDO("U1", "AMS1117-3.3", input_voltage="5V")

    # Improved thermal management (addresses RPN 336 "thermal shutdown")
    ldo.add_thermal_vias(count=9, diameter="0.3mm")

    mcu = MCU("U2", "ESP32-C6")

    # Enhanced decoupling (addresses "power supply noise" failure mode)
    Capacitor("C1", "10uF", "0805") | (ldo["VIN"], ldo["GND"])
    Capacitor("C2", "10uF", "0805") | (ldo["VOUT"], ldo["GND"])
    Capacitor("C3", "100nF", "0402") | (mcu["VDD"], mcu["GND"])  # Close to MCU
```

5. **Re-run analysis** to verify improvements:

```bash
uv run python -m circuit_synth.tools.quality_assurance.fmea_cli ESP32_DevBoard_v2.py -o FMEA_Report_v2.pdf
```

6. **Compare reports**:
   - Verify RPN reduction for addressed failure modes
   - Check for any new failure modes introduced
   - Ensure critical failures are mitigated

## Best Practices

### When to Run FMEA

- **Early design phase** - Identify issues before committing to schematic
- **After major changes** - Verify modifications don't introduce new risks
- **Before prototype** - Catch issues before manufacturing
- **Pre-production review** - Final validation before volume production
- **Post-failure analysis** - Understand field failures and prevent recurrence

### Interpreting Results

**Don't aim for zero risk** - Some low-RPN failures are acceptable and expected.

**Focus on actionable items:**
- RPN â‰¥ 300: Must fix before proceeding
- RPN 125-299: Should fix before production
- RPN 50-124: Consider fixes if low-cost
- RPN < 50: Monitor but generally acceptable

**Consider detection difficulty:**
- High detection (D = 8-10): Add test points, design for testability
- Moderate detection (D = 4-7): Implement automated test procedures
- Low detection (D = 1-3): Failure will be caught in testing

### Continuous Improvement

- **Update knowledge base** - Add failure modes from field experience
- **Track actual failures** - Compare predictions to reality
- **Refine ratings** - Adjust S/O/D based on real-world data
- **Document lessons learned** - Build institutional knowledge
- **Automate in CI/CD** - Run FMEA on every design iteration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No circuit files found"**
- Ensure you're pointing to a `.py` or `.json` circuit file
- Check that the file exists and has the correct extension

**"reportlab not installed"**
- Install PDF generation library: `uv pip install reportlab`

**"Component not recognized"**
- Unknown components get generic failure modes
- Check component symbol naming matches KiCad conventions
- Verify reference designators are standard (R, C, U, J, etc.)

**Empty or minimal report**
- Verify circuit file has components defined
- Check that circuit.serialize() or netlist generation works
- Try running with `-v` verbose flag for diagnostic info

**RPN values seem too high/low**
- Values are based on industry standards for general electronics
- Adjust for your environment using circuit context
- Customize failure mode database for your specific domain
